The purpose of this script to is to a latency check on API end points.  It measures the length of time to perform a GET and POST request.
As well as measures the time difference in time when the user initiates a post request and when the server creates an entry within its database.  

TO RUN:
- You will need to install the following modules via pip:

}
```
- Manually run, simply type:

```

- Cron Job Autorun, the recommended setup for a cron job on OSX or Linux is the following:

*/240 9-17 * * 1-5 python ..(path)../LatencyTest.py
```

CREATED FILES: 
This script will generate a *logger.txt* file that contains a list of test times along with their test data.  Example below:
